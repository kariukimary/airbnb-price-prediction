# airbnb-price-prediction

The project involves prediction ofAirbnb prices, it is a regression problem where i used RandomForestRegressor and LinearRegression. my model worked better when using RandomForestRegressor as compared to LinearRegression. this is because RandomForest can capture non-linear relationships between input features and the target variable, whereas Linear Regression assumes a linear relationship, also RandomForest provides feature importance scores, which can help one  identify which features have the most significant impact on the target variable. Linear Regression coefficients can give one a similar insight, but RandomForest often handles interactions between features more effectively, allowing it to capture complex relationships.
